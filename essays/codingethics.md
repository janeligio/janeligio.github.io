 You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering. Then, describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications. Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?
 
 ## What are Ethics?
 When you first start out programming you get excited at the thought of being able to manipulate a computer to do whatever you want. You build your skills and become capable of doing a lot more. But you start building software but never stop to think if what you're doing is morally sound. I mean, not until you start coding for the real world. When people start to actually use it you understand the scope of your power. It hits you like a bimmer that people will be affected by it be it positively or negatively. You use software everyday and most people don't even think about what goes on behind the scenes. They're putting their entire trust in the software without a thought. That's what coding ethics is. Knowing that the consumer has no choice but to trust you and not taking advantage of it.

Let's take a look at this programmer's [moral predicament](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e). Part of getting into a STEM profression is the pride in knowing you are doing good work as well as being compensated well for it. When your employer gives you a task you do it almost without question. You fulfill the requirements of the project but never stop to think if you should even be doing what you're doing if there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
