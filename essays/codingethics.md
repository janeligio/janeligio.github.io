 <h2 class="ui header">What are Ethics?</h2>
 When you first start out programming you get excited at the thought of being able to manipulate a computer to do whatever you want. You build your skills and become capable of doing a lot more. But you start building software but never stop to think if what you're doing is morally sound. I mean, not until you start coding for the real world. When people start to actually use it you understand the scope of your power. It hits you like a bimmer that people will be affected by it be it positively or negatively. You use software everyday and most people don't even think about what goes on behind the scenes. They're putting their entire trust in the software without a thought. That's what coding ethics is. Knowing that the consumer has no choice but to trust you and not taking advantage of it.

Let's take a look at this programmer's [moral predicament](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e). Part of getting into a STEM profression is the pride in knowing you are doing good work as well as being compensated well for it. When your employer gives you a task you do it almost without question. You fulfill the requirements of the project but never stop to think if you even should be doing what you're doing, if there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It was only until he heard about an innocent girl's suicide that it struck him. He had power. She never even had to see his face to be driven to suicide. 

## The Truth
The harsh reality is that it wasn't the programmers fault. Blame can't be pinned to one lone cause. But who wouldn't have a guilty conscience? Ethics are important to consider when building software because its sole purpose is to help people. We make these programs to make life easier, not to worsen it. That is why it is necessary to use our power and the trust that is confided in us to keep others in mind and have in our best intentions to only help.
