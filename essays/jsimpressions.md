I’ve had some prior experience to Javascript before but that was mostly self-taught with some bits were probably misinformation. 
I was glad to see  a guideline we could follow to learn this expressive language. Learning more about Javascript, you see a complete 
difference compared to language like Java. Things were looser and you were allowed to do more things. Java was very hand-holdy, which
I appreciated at first, when starting to learn it. As I got more into Javascript I realized how frustrating it is to code in Java when 
you’ve started to code in other languages. Everything you write must be explicit and all types must match and everything has to conform
with the syntax rules, otherwise, all hell breaks loose.

So, what the hell is ECMAScript 6 anyways? Some sort of skin condition? Or JSON? It’s still Javascript, right? I still find myself 
struggling with some of the terminology and syntax in Javascript. When to use ```var``` (if at all), ```let```, ```const```. 
Some part of me is scared this will come back to haunt me big time. Like how to create a function or an object. Apparently,
there’s more than one way. With all the updated versions, I hesitate to touch a book published even a year ago. Though I think
I’ll get more comfortable as I continue to code in the language and learn what’s right, wrong, and what’s better.

Syntax has already stumped me. After the first WOD, I realized I need a bit more practice…because, sadly, I DNFed. It wasn’t just that
I DNFed, it was the way I DNFed. I wrote the code I thought was correct within a couple of minutes, I go to run it and I get a nasty
“UnexpectedSyntax Error }”. I spent ¾ of the time just trying to figure out what was syntactically wrong with my code. I went line by
line like a robot desperately trying to find a missing semicolon or an unclosed curly brace. Nothing. Eight minutes passed and I was
prompted to stop. I was fuming because my code looked exactly like how it was solved after the WOD. That’s life, I suppose.
