I entered my freshman year at UH Manoa as an "Exploratory Business" major. I didn't even know what that meant. 
I didn't know much after graduating high school. All I could think was "What Now?". "So then what happens?". 
On a whim I decided to take ICS 111 to try it out. From the very first ```System.out.println("Hello World");``` , 
I was hooked.
