In your programming career thus far, we've all had this insecurity of being ignorant. You soon come to realize this is just part of the game. We were all stupid in the beginning. Now we're...less stupid. The secret to that was not just learning but asking questions. Some people are good at that, some just don't get it. Let's take a look at this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34691691/reading-from-text-file-to-array-of-strings?rq=1).  There's literally no actual question being asked here. For people to give you a good answer, state explicitly what your difficulties and what you are inquiring about. If you didn't have the the time to formulate a better question, what makes you think someone would take their time to answer a bad one?  

To give an example of a good question, take a look at this guy's [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45906747/is-a-list-potentially-divisible-by-another). In this situation, the sections are neatly divided by the inquirer's problem, his approach to how he tried to solve said problem, and his exact question after his approach has failed to garner correct results. You can tell this guy actually did his research and still went bust. People answering these questions appreciate that thought was put in before submitting the question. The answers themselves lead to a better way of understanding the problem referring to methods and algorithms that can be used to further understanding on the subject.

What makes a good question? It's simple. Just realize, it's okay to be dumb. But before accepting defeat, do a little work yourself. See if a simple google search is not sufficient to answering your question. But you've probably tried that by the time you needed to seek further help. When you get there, there are some better strategies you can take. First is the obvious, ask your questions where they're meant to be asked. When you do ask it, ask with humility, in acceptance of your defeat. Relay what information you've uncovered while trying to find the answer. And finally, thank the people answering your question. No one needed to answer that yet some random cheeto dusty-fingered dude with a ponytail decided to.
