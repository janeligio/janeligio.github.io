Do coding standards contribute to the quality of code? Is it important enough to stress others to improve upon it? Probably. But how important?

Consider this line of code. 
```for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    //do something
    }```

So, what the hell is ECMAScript 6 anyways? Some sort of skin condition? Or JSON? It’s still Javascript, right? I still find myself 
struggling with some of the terminology and syntax in Javascript. When to use ```var``` (if at all), ```let```, ```const```. 
Some part of me is scared this will come back to haunt me big time. Like how to create a function or an object. Apparently,
there’s more than one way. With all the updated versions, I hesitate to touch a book published even a year ago. Though I think
I’ll get more comfortable as I continue to code in the language and learn what’s right, wrong, and what’s better.

Syntax has already stumped me. After the first WOD, I realized I need a bit more practice…because, sadly, I DNFed. It wasn’t just that
I DNFed, it was the way I DNFed. I wrote the code I thought was correct within a couple of minutes, I go to run it and I get a nasty
“UnexpectedSyntax Error }”. I spent ¾ of the time just trying to figure out what was syntactically wrong with my code. I went line by
line like a robot desperately trying to find a missing semicolon or an unclosed curly brace. Nothing. Eight minutes passed and I was
prompted to stop. I was fuming because my code looked exactly like how it was solved after the WOD. That’s life, I suppose.
