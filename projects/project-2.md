summary: A program that finds a solution to a sudoku I made in ICS 211.
---

This program I was tasked to create involved a deeper understanding of how to use different methods to solve problems, namely, recursion. The algorithm took a 2-dimensional array as an input and outputted, in text, a possible solution to the sudoku. It was done through brute-force. 

Although this project was difficult to implement, the main take-away was the analysis of the algorithm. As I learned more and more about how to dissect a piece of code, it brought more insight into how I should actually go about solving a problem. The algorithm in question was an extremely inefficient algorithm and even a small input of n would stall the program.
