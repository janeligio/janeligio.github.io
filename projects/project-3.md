summary: A website I started to develop during summer of 2017.
---

During the summer I took up learning a new language to try and dive into the world of web development. I was working at a local cafe at the time and noticed that we were lacking a website. I taught myself HTML and CSS where I played around with design. Later, I would go on to start learning Javascript. Note the word "learning", and not "learn" or "learned" as one does not simply "learn" a language like Javascript. It is an on-going endeavour that I would have to woefully learn. 

It is currently a work in progress and it also marks a divergence of learning paths as I shy away from the very strict object-oriented programming paradigms that Java enforces. This project has me learning new things everyday while at the same time also teaching me how little I know! It is painful process yet oh so rewarding.
