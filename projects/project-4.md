summary: For our ICS 314 class, two other peers and I worked together to create an web app for the UH community to easily find carpools going to school.

  Our team of three were tasked with creating a website that helped UH students with a common problem. We were allowed to choose that problem and so we went with the difficulty of parking on campus. Our solution was to design an app that allowed users to create carpool appointments if they were driving to school and to schedule to be in a carpool if they needed a ride to campus.
